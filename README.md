# IoT Environment Simulator

This project provides a foundation for creating customizable device classes, simulating digital and analog I/O, and enabling user interaction with a realistic IoT environment.

## Features

- **Device Abstraction**: A robust Device base class to represent any device, including legacy, IoT-capable, and hybrid devices.
- **Digital and Analog I/O Simulation**: Support for simulating input/output interactions at the most fundamental level.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily add new device types, protocols, and behaviors using inheritance.
- **Lifecycle Management**: Activate, deactivate, and manage device states dynamically.
- **Custom Metadata**: Attach custom properties to devices using a flexible metadata system.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/IoT_Environment_Simulator.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd IoT_Environment_Simulator
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Create a new device class by inheriting from the `Device` base class.
2. Implement the required methods for your device.
3. Instantiate your device and interact with it using the provided simulation tools.

    ```python
    from device import Device

    # Create a new device
    device = Device(
        manufacturer="LegacyTech",
        make="Series X",
        model="Model 100",
        serial_number="LTX10012345",
        name="Legacy Device",
        description="A non-IoT capable legacy device."
    )

    # Add inputs and outputs
    device.add_input("analog_input_1", "analog")
    device.add_output("digital_output_1", "digital")

    # Activate the device
    device.activate()

    # Interact with inputs/outputs
    print(device.read_input("analog_input_1"))  # Simulated read
    device.write_output("digital_output_1", 1)  # Simulated write

    # Get device info
    print(device.get_info())

    # Deactivate the device
    device.deactivate()
    ```
## Planned Features

- **Enhanced Device Communication**: Implement protocols for device-to-device communication.
- **Cloud Integration**: Enable devices to connect and interact with cloud services.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Add support for data collection and analysis.
- **User Interface**: Develop a web-based interface for managing and monitoring devices.
- **Mobile App**: Create a mobile application for remote device control and monitoring.
- **Security Enhancements**: Implement security features to protect device data and interactions.
